        <img src="images/f1.png" alt="creator">
        <p>My name is Aleksandar Marjanovic and i made this site as a project for the ICT uni, IT course, Web Programming subject. This is my official third or fourth site, made by using vanila javascript, jquery, css and html, which you can all see in the documentation. The first contact with HTML and CSS was 3 years ago when i worked on a World Of Warcraft emulation. Long time has passed since then but the passion stays the same, appart from programming my passion is gaming and basketball, and i tend to keep up with both, now with added content it's a bit harder.Around 30% of the Terms of Service, which in it's original is on this site, and on the vallhala-realms.com respectively is made by me, and i keep that as a small token of my humble begining as a web developer and a token of appreciation to the people in vallhala realms. Aside from programming i am into basketball and the only thing i can't allow myself to be out of shape. I was born in Belgrade, Serbia, and i currently live in Obrenovac.</p>
